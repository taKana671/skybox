# skybox

This repository aims to create skyboxes from cubemaps and images procedurally generated from noise using python and panda3D.
Noise images, cubemaps and cloud cover images were created using programs from [NoiseTexture](https://github.com/taKana671/NoiseTexture) and its submodule [texture_generator](https://github.com/taKana671/texture_generator).
